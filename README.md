# 🧠 Emoji Mind Trick

Emoji Mind Trick is a web-based **mathematical mind-reading illusion** built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
The project appears to magically predict the emoji a user is thinking of using a clever number-logic trick.

🌐 **Live Demo:** https://mathstrick.vercel.app

## 🎯 Project Objective

To demonstrate how **simple mathematics and logical patterns** can be used to create an illusion of mind reading in a fun and interactive way.

This project is suitable for:
- Science & engineering expos  
- Classroom demonstrations  
- Logic and mathematics awareness programs  
- Interactive web demos  

---

## 🪄 How the Trick Works

1. The user chooses any **two-digit number**.
2. They **add the digits** of that number.
3. They **subtract the sum** from the original number.
4. The final result always follows a predictable mathematical pattern.
5. Each valid result is mapped to a specific **emoji**.
6. When the user presses **Enter**, the application reveals the exact emoji — creating a mind-reading illusion.

✨ Emojis are **randomized on every page refresh**, so the trick feels new each time.
